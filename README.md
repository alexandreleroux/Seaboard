# ROLI Seaboard collaborative documentation

Description: ROLI Seaboard collaborative documentation
Version: 0.1

---

Welcome! You just found a wealth of information to help you make the best out of your ROLI Seaboard.

1. What was first started is a [guide to help you fully enjoy playing with your ROLI Seaboard](playing/)

2. Eventually you'll find [documentation of the ROLI Seaboard presets](presets/)

If you'd like to see anything else in here, [let me know in the issue tracker](https://github.com/alexandreleroux/Seaboard/issues)! :-)

By the way I'm Alex, aka Satri. Amongst many other things, I'm an electronic musician. I play solos with modern synthesizers such as Moog Music's award-winning Animoog and Model 15 apps, as well as the ROLI Seaboard. You'll learn more about [my free albums of improvized solos here](http://animoog.org/satri).  I'm planning to record solos with my new ROLI Seaboard RISE 49, and just like my other albums, it will be Creative Commons-licensed. In the process of recording this album, I'm starting this documentation to keep track of valuable info I find. [You are invited to contribute to this guide](contribute.md). All Seaboard players will benefit from your insights.
