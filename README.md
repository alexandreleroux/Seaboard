# ROLI Seaboard collaborative documentation

Welcome! You just found a wealth of information to help you make the best out of your ROLI Seaboard.

1. What was first started is a [guide to help you fully enjoy playing with your ROLI Seaboard](/playing/)

2. Eventually you'll find _[not written yet]_ [documentation of the ROLI Seaboard presets](/presets/)

If you'd like to see anything else in here, [let me know in the issue tracker](https://github.com/alexandreleroux/Seaboard/issues)! :-)

You're new to the ROLI Seaboard? I recommend these two 1-minute videos which efficiently demonstrate what kind of controller the ROLI Seaboard is:

Short demo of the ROLI Seaboard:<br>

Playing 'Cantor Digitalis' on the ROLI Seaboard:<br>

By the way I'm Alex, aka Satri. Amongst many other things, I'm an electronic musician. I play solos with modern synthesizers such as Moog Music's award-winning Animoog and Model 15 apps, as well as the ROLI Seaboard. You'll learn more about [my free albums of improvised solos here](http://animoog.org/satri).  I'm planning to record solos with my new ROLI Seaboard RISE 49, and just like my other albums, it will be Creative Commons-licensed. In the process of recording this album, I'm starting this documentation to keep track of valuable info I find.

[You are invited to contribute to this guide](/contribute.md). All Seaboard players will benefit from your insights. Thanks -- Alex / Satri
