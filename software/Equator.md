=== Samples ===

"you can actually import your own samples into Equator. Equator supports .wav files and .sfz samples format. 

If a user creates an instrument folder in: ~/Documents/ROLI/Equator/Samples and places all their sample files in there, then creates a .sfz file in that folder too, Equator will pick up that sample instrument the next time it is opened.
.roliaudio is just our encrypted format so users can not re-use or share our sample library. Underneath this encryption is just a set of .wav files and an sfz file."
