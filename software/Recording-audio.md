# Recording the audio of ROLI Seaboard performances

The ROLI Equator software does not allow users to record audio of Seaboard performances.

# On the Mac

Using Quicktime
* Apparently recording the Mac's audio through Quicktime works but users have reported skipping issues. Anyone can confirm?

Using Rogue Amoeba Audio Hijack
* To record your Seaboard performance in an audio file (e.g. .mp3, .acc), I haven't found any better way than by purchasing [Rogue Amoeba's Audio Hijack](http://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/) software. [The Soundflower open source software](https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower) that should constitute a solution has not been updated since 2014 and failed to work properly for me.
