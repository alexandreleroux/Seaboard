[ROLI software](software.md), while generally well designed and offering numerous features, won't allow you to record your Seaboard performances. Ableton Live software is one of the popular options available on the Mac for Seaboard players to record their performances. There are however multiple very important steps, detailed in the links below, that *must* be completed to properly record the ROLI Seaboard with Ableton Live.

This page has been useful to you and you can spend a few more minutes? I'm preparing an album of improvised ROLI Seaboard RISE 49 solos. It will be available on http://satri.bandcamp.com. You can have an idea of my playing style thanks to my [previous albums of improvised Animoog and Model 15 solos](http://animoog.org/satri), which you will find [for free at the same place](http://satri.bandcamp.com).
