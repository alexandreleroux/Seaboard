# Software for the ROLI Seaboard

## Official software

Desktop:
* Equator
 * Runs on macOS and Windows
 * Download the additional presets. It's available as a `Equator Extended Library OSX 1.9.4.mpkg` from your [My ROLI](https://my.roli.com) webpage. These presets can also be downloaded directly from the Equator app in the Preset Browser > Online. As far as I can tell, these presets are not available for the iPad 'Seaboard 5D' app and thus make using Equator on the desktop more enticing than playing from your iPad.  
* ROLI Dashboard
* [ROLI Seaboard API](https://github.com/WeAreROLI/SeaboardAPI)
 * To use the Seaboard with JUCE, oF, Cinder, Processing, Objective-C, Python, Max/MSP or SuperCollider

Mobile:
* Seaboard 5D
 * iOS-only at the moment
 * Fewer presets available than the ROLI Equator desktop software
