# MIDI and the Seaboard

The Seaboard doesn't play sounds by itself. It needs to be connected to software to generate sounds. MIDI is the data transfer standard with which the Seaboard talks to software.

MIDI can be transferred wired or wirelessly. Wired can be via USB or MIDI Cables. The Seaboard has a USB connection. Wireless transmission of MIDI is possible as well, and the Seaboard supports it through the Bluetooth standard.
