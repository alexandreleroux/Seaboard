# TO-DO

* it comes with the Audio Unit for the AudioFront MIDI Expression iO which I strongly recommend if you add a new depth to your expressive breath on any music setup, including when playing the ROLI Seaboard as demonstrated by the tracks I have created by playing one of the bundled presets on my ROLI Seaboard RISE 49 with AudioFront's MIDI Expression iO. If you think all the MIDI devices you want in your music setup will all be connected by Bluetooth, which is nowadays pretty frequent in current for electronic music devices, the you might want to opt for AudioFront's MIDI Expression Quattro (VALIDER NOM)   
  * issue: move this to its own page as a git tree blog entry type of post
