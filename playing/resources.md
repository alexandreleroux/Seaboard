## How-to

Connecting the ROLI to Garageband:

* Here's the [official guide](https://support.roli.com/article/using-the-seaboard-with-garageband/)
* This guide presumes you know how to load audio plugins in Garageband. For instance, enabling the ROLI Equator audio plugin in Garageband is required to record the Seaboard's MIDI in Garageband. [Follow this link to learn how you](https://support.native-instruments.com/hc/en-us/articles/210292525-How-to-Insert-Native-Instruments-Plug-ins-in-GarageBand)
* For an accurate playback, it is crucial to desactivate the quantitisation of the notes, for which the default is set to 'double-croche'. Failure to update this setting means that unless one has followed the tempo on a whole track, the playback will be quite different from the original performance
* Here's the Garageband template I use to record my own Seaboard tracks: [Garageband-SeaboardRISE49_template.band](TO DO INCLUDE)
 * This template comes with the ROLI Seaboard RISE 49 audio plugin ready to start recording, but __you still need to manually turn off notes quantitisation every time you open the file__ to ensure accurate playback. [Help us request that this setting is saved within a .band file](TO-BE-CREATED) in order for the track to set the quantization automatically while loading the project
 * To ensure you get the latest version of this file, if it gets improved and adapted to future versions of Garageband, we suggest that you [fork this repository]() and clone your fork on your Mac with [GitHub Desktop]()
 * Once you retrieved the file, lock it to ensure it doesn't get overwritten. You do that by selecting the file, press Command-i and enable the 'Lock' checkbox. After you open your template in Garagaband, you'll have to select 'Save as'. [provide nomenclature rules in yaml]
 * You can maximize the Garagaband display by clicking on the green dot at the top-left of the window, but in doing so you'll lose the ROLI Seaboard audio plugin anymore only Garageband will be shown. This trick can be used to move from one view to the other.
