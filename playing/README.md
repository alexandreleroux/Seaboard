# Learning to play the ROLI Seaboard

This is a collaborative guide that has the goal to document how to have fun with our ROLI Seaboards.

Let's define the sections of this guide:

* Introduction
 * That's what you're reading right now
* [Everything about its hardware](the-hardware.md)
* [Connecting the ROLI ]
* [Resources](resources.md)
 * YouTube videos, official manuals, related websites, social media and more  

You're most probably looking for something specific. An easy way to reach your destination is by using the `search this project box` at the top right of this page. You can browse the guide simply by following links. If you see links that are in red, it means this part of the guide doesn't exist yet. Here's [now how easy it is to contribute to these pages](contribute.md).
